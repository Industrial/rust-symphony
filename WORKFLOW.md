# Prompt template (how the agent receives the ticket)

The text below is the prompt sent to the agent for each issue. Edit it to change how the ticket is presented.
Liquid variables: `issue` (title, identifier, state, description, url, labels), optional `attempt` (retry number), optional `workflow` (when set: `workflow.pr_base_branch` — base branch for worker branches and PR target, e.g. main or develop).
See https://shopify.github.io/liquid/ for syntax.

**Tracker and completion:** The runner only **reads** the tracker (no write access). When the agent is done, it should **close the issue** (or move it to a terminal state) using its own tools (e.g. GitHub CLI, API, or a comment for a human to close). Once the issue is closed, the runner will stop re-dispatching it on the next poll.

**Claim label (Addendum 1):** Add the claim label `symphony-claimed` to this issue as your first step (e.g. `gh issue edit … --add-label symphony-claimed`). That prevents other workers from picking the same issue and survives restarts.

**PR-driven handoff (Addendum 1):** Worker branches MUST be based off the configured base branch (e.g. fetch and checkout `main` or the branch in `workflow.pr_base_branch`, then create `symphony/issue-<number>` from it). When opening a PR, target that same base (e.g. `gh pr create --base {{ workflow.pr_base_branch | default: "main" }} --body "Fixes #N"`). You MUST (1) push your branch, (2) open a PR with body containing "Fixes #N", (3) post a comment on this issue with the PR URL. Do not consider the task complete until all three are done. Use `gh pr create` and `gh issue comment <number> --body "PR: <url>"` if available. Do **not** merge the PR—a human merges; closing the issue happens when the PR is merged. Optionally add the label `pr-open` to the issue when the PR is open.

# Symphony workflow — RustSymphony

You are working on a GitHub issue for the **RustSymphony** project (a Rust implementation of the Symphony orchestrator).

## Issue

- **Title:** {{ issue.title }}
- **Identifier:** {{ issue.identifier }}
- **State:** {{ issue.state }}
{% if issue.url %}
- **URL:** {{ issue.url }}
{% endif %}
{% if issue.labels.size > 0 %}
- **Labels:** {{ issue.labels | join: ", " }}
{% endif %}

{% if issue.description %}
## Description

{{ issue.description }}
{% endif %}

{% if attempt %}
## Attempt

This is **attempt {{ attempt }}**. A previous run may have been interrupted or failed; continue from the current state of the git worktree.
{% endif %}

## Instructions

1. **Claim the issue** (if the workflow uses a claim label): Add the claim label to this issue first (e.g. `gh issue edit … --add-label symphony-claimed`) so no other worker picks it up.
2. Read the issue and the codebase in this git worktree.
3. **Fix-PR runs (SPEC_ADDENDUM_2 B.7):** If this issue already has an open PR (e.g. you were re-dispatched because CI failed or someone requested changes): use the **current branch**, pull or rebase as needed, make changes to address the failure or review feedback, commit and push. Do **not** open a new PR. When done, you may post a short comment on the issue or PR (e.g. "Pushed fixes for CI.").
4. **New work:** Otherwise, implement what the issue asks for. Use a single branch per issue (e.g. `symphony/issue-<number>`), created from the base branch (e.g. `main` or `{{ workflow.pr_base_branch | default: "main" }}`), if opening a PR.
5. Run tests and fix any failures (`devenv shell -- moon run :test` as appropriate).
6. Follow project conventions (see `.cursor/rules`, `docs/`, and existing code).
7. When done, either:
   - **PR-driven:** You MUST complete all of: (1) push your branch, (2) open a PR with body "Fixes #N" targeting the base branch (e.g. `gh pr create --base main --body "Fixes #N"` or use `--base {{ workflow.pr_base_branch | default: "main" }}` when the variable is set), (3) post a comment on this issue with the PR link (e.g. `gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "PR: https://github.com/…"`). Do not exit until all three are done. Do not merge the PR—a human merges. Optionally add the `pr_open_label` to the issue when the PR is open. **Or**
   - **Direct close:** Summarize in a comment, then **close this issue** (e.g. `gh issue close` or GitHub UI) so the runner stops picking it up. If you cannot close issues, add a clear "ready to close" comment for a maintainer.

## Before you're done (required for PR-driven flow)

If you are using the PR-driven handoff, you must complete every item before exiting:

- [ ] Branch pushed to origin
- [ ] PR opened with body containing "Fixes #N" (replace N with the issue number from this ticket)
- [ ] Comment on this issue with the PR link
